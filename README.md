# CP Problem Visualizer

CP Problem Visualizer is a terminal-based C++ tool that helps visualize
how competitive programming algorithms work internally.

Instead of only producing the final output, the program prints each step
of execution, such as pointer movement in Binary Search, queue evolution
in BFS, recursion flow in DFS, and table construction in Dynamic Programming.

This project is designed to improve understanding, debugging, and clear
explanation of algorithmic solutions commonly used in competitive programming.

## Algorithms Visualized
- Binary Search
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci)

## Tech Stack
- C++
- STL
- Algorithms
